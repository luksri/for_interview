PDF table extraction can be done in many ways. Some examples:
    * A custom config file indicating where each table is (string-based matching, column distinction, etc.)
    * Using OpenCV for table detection or row separation 
    * A third-party library such as Camelot-Py or Tabula-Py-Hardcoded strings
